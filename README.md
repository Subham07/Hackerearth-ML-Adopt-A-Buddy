https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/hackerearth-machine-learning-challenge-pet-adoption/machine-learning/pet-adoption-9-5838c75b/

We have been given training and testing dataset which has columns like the Pet_Id , Condition , Color , Issue and Listing Date. The target variables are the breed_category and pet_category which we need to predict

As there are two classes , the approach taken is training two models for each classes and then testing seperately and appending the final result.

All the code with explanations are given in the .ipynb file.

I have also given training and testing data for reference.

Notebook was created in Google Colab
